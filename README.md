# Vulnerability Shop

Vulnerability Shop is an e-commerce web application meant to help with security research. The application contains various security vulnerabilities by design. These vulnerabilities can be exploited manually or by using our [load generator](https://github.com/vulnerability-shop/load-generator).

We do not recommend using this application in a production environment.

## Setup instructions

**Requirements:**

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

**Steps:**

1. Clone this repository on your machine

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/vulnerability-shop/vulnerability-shop.git
```

2. Switch directory to the newly cloned repository

```bash
    cd vulnerability-shop
```

3. Start the application using `docker-compose`

```bash
    docker-compose up
```
# Populate the database
When the containers are up, a script will run automatically to import the data from the CSV files.

## Manually importing data into the database
```bash
docker exec vulnerability-shop_database_1 /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/import.sh
```

## Docker-compose commands 
You might need to use these if the data import does not work.

- Rebuild the database container
```bash
docker-compose build database
```
- Delete existing volumes
```bash
docker-compose down -v
```
